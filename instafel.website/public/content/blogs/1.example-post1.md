# About Instafel Updater

Instafel Updater is actually designed to eliminate the hassle of automatic updates **for root users**. It does this by checking for Instafel updates at certain intervals in the background with **WorkManager** and **Foreground Service** and installing them silently with Shizuku. This guide covers how you can use Instafel Updater.

## Download and Setup Shizuku

Instafel Updater gets help from Android's Session Installer to install APKs without user approval. To add this support to the application, it will be enough to install and start [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/guide/setup/).

**Steps**

1. You can download Shizuku from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api)
2. You can start Shizuku via **ADB** or **ROOT** mode. It is recommended to start it via ROOT mode for an uninterrupted experience.
3. Select **Authorized applications** and authorize **Instafel Updater** (me.mamiiblt.instafel.updater)

You can find detailed guile in [Shizuku's User Manual](https://shizuku.rikka.app/guide/setup/)
